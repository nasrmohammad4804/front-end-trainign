    <pre><p>I'm not a of artificial intelligence. It's not that I don't see the 
           positive impact of these technologies. I've worked on AI based
           projects at IBM that were designed to perform tedious
           bureaucratic work quickly. My concern is that we're making very
           powerful yet easy-to-use tools to generate deceptive written and
           visual content(audio and video aren't too far off) that is
           becoming more and more difficult to interpret as authentically
           created by human. We're on a path to destroy the Internet-and
           maybe worse--as we know it today.I've been feeling like an <span class="blue-text">old

                        life-like but life-less state of being online.</blockquote> </pre>
